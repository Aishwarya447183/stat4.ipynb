The Poisson distribution, on the other hand, models the number of rare events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",

    "Assumptions: The Binomial distribution assumes that the trials are independent and identically distributed, while the Poisson distribution assumes that the events occur independently of each other, and the rate at which they occur is constant over time or space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability of success: In the Binomial distribution, the probability of success is constant for each trial, and denoted by p. In the Poisson distribution, the probability of an event occurring in a fixed interval of time or space is denoted by λ, which represents the average number of events per interval.\n",

    "Number of trials or events: The Binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of trials, denoted by n. The Poisson distribution models the number of rare events occurring in a fixed interval, but there is no fixed limit on the number of events that can occur.\n",

    "Shape: The Binomial distribution has a bell-shaped curve that approaches a normal distribution as the number of trials increases, while the Poisson distribution has a skewed shape that is often right-skewed.\n",

    "Relationship: The Poisson distribution is actually a limiting case of the Binomial distribution, where the number of trials is large and the probability of success is small, such that np = λ. As n increases and p decreases, the Binomial distribution approaches the Poisson distribution.\n",
